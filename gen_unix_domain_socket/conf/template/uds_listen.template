/**
 * Description:
 *     Listen for connections on a socket.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *     file_descriptor - socket descriptor
 *
 * Return value:
 *     status - on success, zero is returned | UDS_ERROR and error number is
 *              set to indicate the error:
 *                  EADDRINUSE (another socket is already listening on
 *                              same port)
 *                  EBADF (not a valid file descriptor)
 *                  ENOTSOCK (file descriptor does not refer to a socket)
 *                  EOPNOTSUPP (socket is not of a type that supports listen()
 *                              operation)
 *
 * Standards:
 *     POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008
